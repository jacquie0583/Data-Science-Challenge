On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. 


##  a.  Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data. 
Possibly the incorrect AOV calcuations are due to the calculating the total_items with the aggregate, count(),function instead of sum().  With the count()function provides the number of rows, sum() allows for adding of the values in the total_items colums.  Other influences like outliers and faulty data could have affected on the metric.

##  b.  What metric would you report for this dataset?
Once the outliers are removed the reason for the skewed data becames apparent.  So the median becomes a solid meteric; wanting to use multiple metrics the interquartile range and the the average value per each store.  The latter explains the revenue numbers per each store per month and it shows the stores with the outliers.  Historical data can provide insight as to the stores' revenue and see if numbers increased or decreased with the previous time periods.

The Average Order Value metric is the sum of both 'order_amount' and 'total-amount', as follows:

oa_sum = data_df['order_amount].sum()
ti_sum = data_df['total_itmes'].sum()
Then,
AOV = oa_sum/ti_sum
##  c. What is its value?
AOV = $357.92

#  Question 2: For this question youâ€™ll need to use SQL. Follow this link to access the data set required for the challenge. Please use queries to answer the following questions. Paste your queries along with your final numerical answers below.

##  a.  How many orders were shipped by Speedy Express in total?

CREATE VIEW Shipper_Orders AS
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Orders.ShipperID, Shippers.ShipperName
FROM Orders 
JOIN Shippers
ON Shippers.ShipperID=Orders.ShipperID;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Orders
WHERE ShipperName = 'Speedy Express';

ANSWER: 54


##  b.  What is the last name of the employee with the most orders?

CREATE VIEW Employee_Orders AS 
SELECT Orders.EmployeeID, Employees.LastName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Orders
JOIN Employees
ON Employees.EmployeeID=Orders.EmployeeID; 

SELECT LastName, COUNT(*)
FROM Employee_Orders
GROUP BY LastName
ORDER BY COUNT(*) desc;

ANSWER: Peacock, 40 

##  c. What product was ordered the most by customers in Germany?

CREATE VIEW Products_Ordered AS
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.Country, OrderDetails.Quantity, Products.ProductName
FROM Orders, OrderDetails
JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID
JOIN Products ON OrderDetails.ProductID=Products.ProductID
WHERE Country='Germany';

CREATE VIEW Product_Orders AS
SELECT ProductName, Quantity, COUNT(*) as 'Orders'
FROM Products_Ordered
GROUP BY ProductName;

SELECT ProductName, Quantity, Orders, (Quantity * Orders) AS TotalOrdered
FROM Product_Orders
ORDER BY TotalOrdered desc
LIMIT 1;

Answer:  

ProductName - Camembert Pierrot
Quantity - 40 
Orders - 300
TotalOrdered - 12000
